# CERN Particle Data Analyses

This repository contains two high-energy-physics analyses performed on **open 13 TeV ATLAS data from CERN**, using Python and the ROOT framework.  
Each reproduces or validates a key Standard Model result while demonstrating professional-grade data-science methodology.

Originally conducted at UC Irvine as part of an advanced physics lab course during COVID-19. Please note, normally we would replicate an important
experimental discovery in physics in the actual lab, then write a research paper on our findings. Due to COVID-19 we couldn't use the lab, so our 
professors had to get creative. They decided to assign us experiments which could be done remotely - We were to write code to analyze large publicly 
available datasets from CERN, replicate important experiments in particle physics, then write research papers on our findings. The only problem is,
neither particle physics nor programming courses were pre-requisites for this course. Particle Physics is a topic not normally covered in an
undergraduate curriculum. And while a few of my classmates were proficient in programming, the majority of my classmates and I had only taken the required,
very basic, intro to python course which was completely inadequate to prepare us for what was being asked of us. 

I dropped one of my other classes to make time and began working 10+ hours a day every day on these projects. The professors did their best, and I couldn't have done it
without their office hours, but 3 hours of lecture per week is simply not enough time to bootstrap us through particle physics and programming in a single quarter. 
By working hard, long, consistent hours every day, I was able to self learn enough about particle physics and programming to complete this project on my own. 
More than half the class failed to submit a completed research project, along with their code, at the end of the quarter. Since the class is graded on a curve, 
I could have quit early and been fine. But I was determined to see this through, I was determined to see how far I could get. The results of that are the contents 
of this repository. I worked with a partner, but all code and papers are written by me exclusively. Partner was required to write his own code and project, and we
worked together on understanding and progressing through the experiment.

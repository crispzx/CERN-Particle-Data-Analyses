# CERN Particle Data Analyses

This repository contains two high-energy-physics analyses performed on **open 13 TeV ATLAS data from CERN**, using Python and the ROOT framework.  
Each reproduces or validates a key Standard Model result while demonstrating professional-grade data-science methodology.
